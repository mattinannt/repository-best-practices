# Best Practices for Public Repositories
If you are showcasing your work on Github or maintaining a public repository, make sure you are using the features provided by Github to best present the information and provide all the information users of your code need.

## 1. The name

Make sure your name best describes what your project is about (The repository name can only contain ASCII letters, digits, and the characters ., - and _.). Try to avoid generic titles like `my-repository` or `machine-learning-project`.

## 2. Meta information

Use the gear icon next to the description to customize the meta information of your repository.

### The Description

Use the repository description to give more information about your project. This description is also displayed when you share the repository link or when it is listed in your Github profile.

### Topics

Topics are tags that can be used to increase the visibility of your repository. Set topics that match your repository, such as programming languages used (e.g. `python`, `machine-learning` or `web-development`) or use cases of the project (e.g. `experience management`, `surveys` or `calendar`).

### Hide unused blocks

Deselect any functionality (blocks) at the bottom of the modal that you don't need, to avoid cluttering your repository with unused information and empty meta blocks.

## 3. The readme

The readme (a `README.md` file inside your repository) is one of the most important parts of your repository, as it's like the home page of your repository. It should contain all the important information about your repository, how to use your code, how to set up the development environment for your project, and how to contribute to your code. Include screenshots and images if possible to make the readme more appealing to your users, and get inspiration for the structure from other repositories or tools like ChatGPT.

## 4. License

Make sure you have added a license to your repository. The license is located in a single file named `LICENSE`.

A license is an important part of any GitHub repository, especially if you want others to use, contribute to, or distribute your code. It provides legal protection and clarity, and fosters an environment of open collaboration.

* **Legal Clarity**: A license clearly states the terms under which others can use, modify, and distribute your code. Without a license, the default legal position is that others have no rights to do any of these things.
* **Protect your rights**: A license can help protect your rights as a creator by specifying how your work can be used. For example, some licenses require that any derivative works also be open source (copyleft), while others allow your code to be used in proprietary software.
* **Open Source Contribution**: If you want others to use and contribute to your project, a license provides the necessary legal framework. It makes clear what contributors can and cannot do, and under what conditions their contributions will be accepted.

There are many different licenses available. Please take the time to learn about the different types of licenses and their restrictions and limitations, and don't take this repository as legal advice.
A good starting point for a license is the `MIT` license, as it allows others to use your code in any way they want (including commercially).
But especially if you also have code or a dataset created by other developers in your repository, make sure that your license matches the license terms of the existing code or dataset.
